// constants.ts
export const USER_MODEL = 'USER_MODEL';
export const DATABASE_CONNECTION = 'DATABASE_CONNECTION';
export const  secret: 'DO NOT USE THIS VALUE. INSTEAD, CREATE A COMPLEX SECRET AND KEEP IT SAFE OUTSIDE OF THE SOURCE CODE.',
};
We'll use this to share our key between the JWT signing and verifying steps.

WARNING
Do not expose this key publicly. We have done so here to make it clear what the code is doing, but in a production system you must protect this key using appropriate measures such as a secrets vault, environment variable, or configuration service.
Now, open auth.module.ts in the auth folder and update it to look like this:

auth/auth.module.tsJS

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';
import { JwtModule } from '@nestjs/jwt';
import { AuthController } from './auth.controller';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Module({
  imports: [
    UsersModule,
    JwtModule.register({
      global: true,
      secret: jwtConstants.secret,
      signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [AuthService],
  controllers: [AuthController],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
HINT
We're registering the JwtModule as global to make things easier for us. This means that we don't need to import the JwtModule anywhere else in our application.
We configure the JwtModule using register(), passing in a configuration object. See here for more on the Nest JwtModule and here for more details on the available configuration options.

Let's go ahead and test our routes using cURL again. You can test with any of the user objects hard-coded in the UsersService.


$ # POST to /auth/login
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -d '{"username": "john", "password": "changeme"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
{"access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."}
$ # Note: above JWT truncated
Implementing the authentication guard#
We can now address our final requirement: protecting endpoints by requiring a valid JWT be present on the request. We'll do this by creating an AuthGuard that we can use to protect our routes.

auth/auth.guard.tsJS

import {
  CanActivate,
  ExecutionContext,
  Injectable,
  UnauthorizedException,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { JwtService } from '@nestjs/jwt';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';
import { Request } from 'express';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private jwtService: JwtService) {}

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const token = this.extractTokenFromHeader(request);
    if (!token) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    try {
      const payload = await this.jwtService.verifyAsync(
        token,
        {
          secret: jwtConstants.secret
        }
      );
      // ðŸ’¡ We're assigning the payload to the request object here
      // so that we can access it in our route handlers
      request['user'] = payload;
    } catch {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return true;
  }

  private extractTokenFromHeader(request: Request): string | undefined {
    const [type, token] = request.headers.authorization?.split(' ') ?? [];
    return type === 'Bearer' ? token : undefined;
  }
}
We can now implement our protected route and register our AuthGuard to protect it.

Open the auth.controller.ts file and update it as shown below:

auth.controller.tsJS

import {
  Body,
  Controller,
  Get,
  HttpCode,
  HttpStatus,
  Post,
  Request,
  UseGuards
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from './auth.guard';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  @HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK)
  @Post('login')
  signIn(@Body() signInDto: Record<string, any>) {
    return this.authService.signIn(signInDto.username, signInDto.password);
  }

  @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
  @Get('profile')
  getProfile(@Request() req) {
    return req.user;
  }
}
We're applying the AuthGuard that we just created to the GET /profile route so that it will be protected.

Ensure the app is running, and test the routes using cURL.


$ # GET /profile
$ curl http://localhost:3000/auth/profile
{"statusCode":401,"message":"Unauthorized"}

$ # POST /auth/login
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -d '{"username": "john", "password": "changeme"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
{"access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vybm..."}

$ # GET /profile using access_token returned from previous step as bearer code
$ curl http://localhost:3000/auth/profile -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vybm..."
{"sub":1,"username":"john","iat":...,"exp":...}
Note that in the AuthModule, we configured the JWT to have an expiration of 60 seconds. This is too short an expiration, and dealing with the details of token expiration and refresh is beyond the scope of this article. However, we chose that to demonstrate an important quality of JWTs. If you wait 60 seconds after authenticating before attempting a GET /auth/profile request, you'll receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This is because @nestjs/jwt automatically checks the JWT for its expiration time, saving you the trouble of doing so in your application.

We've now completed our JWT authentication implementation. JavaScript clients (such as Angular/React/Vue), and other JavaScript apps, can now authenticate and communicate securely with our API Server.

Enable authentication globally#
If the vast majority of your endpoints should be protected by default, you can register the authentication guard as a global guard and instead of using @UseGuards() decorator on top of each controller, you could simply flag which routes should be public.

First, register the AuthGuard as a global guard using the following construction (in any module, for example, in the AuthModule):


providers: [
  {
    provide: APP_GUARD,
    useClass: AuthGuard,
  },
],
With this in place, Nest will automatically bind AuthGuard to all endpoints.

Now we must provide a mechanism for declaring routes as public. For this, we can create a custom decorator using the SetMetadata decorator factory function.


import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const IS_PUBLIC_KEY = 'isPublic';
export const Public = () => SetMetadata(IS_PUBLIC_KEY, true);
In the file above, we exported two constants. One being our metadata key named IS_PUBLIC_KEY, and the other being our new decorator itself that weâ€™re going to call Public (you can alternatively name it SkipAuth or AllowAnon, whatever fits your project).

Now that we have a custom @Public() decorator, we can use it to decorate any method, as follows:


@Public()
@Get()
findAll() {
  return [];
}
Lastly, we need the AuthGuard to return true when the "isPublic" metadata is found. For this, we'll use the Reflector class (read more here).


@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private jwtService: JwtService, private reflector: Reflector) {}

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const isPublic = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride<boolean>(IS_PUBLIC_KEY, [
      context.getHandler(),
      context.getClass(),
    ]);
    if (isPublic) {
      // ðŸ’¡ See this condition
      return true;
    }

    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const token = this.extractTokenFromHeader(request);
    if (!token) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    try {
      const payload = await this.jwtService.verifyAsync(token, {
        secret: jwtConstants.secret,
      });
      // ðŸ’¡ We're assigning the payload to the request object here
      // so that we can access it in our route handlers
      request['user'] = payload;
    } catch {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return true;
  }

  private extractTokenFromHeader(request: Request): string | undefined {
    const [type, token] = request.headers.authorization?.split(' ') ?? [];
    return type === 'Bearer' ? token : undefined;
  }
}
Passport integration#
Passport is the most popular node.js authentication library, well-known by the community and successfully used in many production applications. It's straightforward to integrate this library with a Nest application using the @nestjs/passport module.

To learn how you can integrate Passport with NestJS, check out this chapter.

Example#
You can find a complete version of the code in this chapter here.
